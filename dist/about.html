          <p>
            My career as a programmer began back in 1998, when I became
            interested in web page creation in a school computer science group.
            After leaving school in 2000, I entered the university in a
            specialty with a complex name, but related directly to programming
            and automation. After one year of successful training, I decided to
            pause and radically change the direction of my studies. As a result,
            I became an agronomist. Despite the fact that 20 years have passed
            after school, I again became interested in programming and now I am
            actively developing in this direction.

          <h3>HTML, CSS, SCSS</h3>

          <p>
            I have known html since school, but css is new for me. When creating
            this site, I used the SASS language for the first time, which turned
            out to be a very convenient tool when developing complex styles.

          <p>
            I started learning programming in JavaScript, as the most popular
            programming language. Definitely, I did not have time to learn all
            the possibilities, but I am constantly improving my skills and I
            succeed in doing something.

          <h3>REACT.JS</h3>

          <p>
            React is one of the most powerful technologies in web development
            today, this cause I am started studying it and have already tried to
            write my first project using React.
